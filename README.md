Unit Testing an ASP.â€‹NET Core Application



ASP.NET Core 2.0 is out and it is great. Testing worked well in the previous versions, but in 2.0 it is much more easier.

Xunit, Moq and FluentAssertions are working great with the new Version of .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. Using this tools Unit Testing is really fun. Even more fun with testing is provided in ASP.NET Core. Testing Controllers wasn't easier in the previous versions.

If you remember the old Web API and MVC version, based on System.Web, you'll probably also remember how to write unit test for the Controllers.

In this post I'm going to show you how to unit test your controllers and how to write integration tests for your controllers.
